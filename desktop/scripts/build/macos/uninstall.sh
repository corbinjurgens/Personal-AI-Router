# Manual, user-run full uninstaller for NVIDIA PAIR. Shipped inside
# the app bundle at Contents/Resources/installer-tools/uninstall-macos.sh.
#
# macOS auto-update uses Squirrel.Mac (an in-place .app swap) and never runs this
# script or any pkg script, so there is no update-vs-uninstall gating here -- it
# is only ever invoked deliberately by the user. Every delete is best-effort: a
# locked or missing path is ignored and the script continues.
#
# Removing the app and removing your data are separate steps, as they are on the
# other platforms: the Windows uninstaller asks, and `apt remove` keeps data
# while `apt purge` also discards it. So this keeps per-user data — settings,
# logs, cluster identity and certificates, and engines NVIDIA PAIR
# installed — unless --purge is passed. Downloaded model weights live outside
# these roots (~/.ollama, ~/.llamacpp, ~/.lmstudio/models) and are never touched
# either way: every engine declares its model store as models_dir, and a test in
# services/nvpair-engine-manager fails if one resolves inside the app data root.
