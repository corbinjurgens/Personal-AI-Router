# Microservice: Engine Manager (`nvpair-engine-manager`)

## 1. Purpose
A declarative, config-driven control plane for **local inference engines**
(currently Ollama, LM Studio, and llama.cpp). It owns an engine's entire
lifecycle *except serving inference* — locate, install, launch, stop, restart,
health, and config-declared actions — so one uniform API manages any engine
across OSes with no per-engine code. A third party drops in a JSON manifest and
their engine's install/launch/controls "just appear" over the same API: the core
extensibility story for an open-source product.

## 2. Scope
**In scope**
- Broker-coordinated argument/server/proxy settings, literal argument
  persistence, ownership validation and pinned peer settings synchronization.
  The normative operation and failure contract is
  [ENGINE_SETTINGS.md](../nvpair-ui-broker/ENGINE_SETTINGS.md); launch grammar is
  [LAUNCH_TEXT.md](LAUNCH_TEXT.md).
- Detect installation; **user-mode** install (HTTPS download + checksum-verify-when-pinned + run) per OS/arch.
- Lifecycle: start (with readiness probe), stop, restart, status, periodic health.
- Persistent server-port changes preserve arguments, environment and unrelated
  manifest overrides. Resetting to the bundled port removes only shared and
  host-platform port overrides, deleting the file only when it has no other
  settings. Host-platform precedence must not override a successfully saved port
  on reload; malformed existing overrides fail the save and remain intact.
- Config-declared **actions** mapped to each engine's local control API:
  Ollama declares `list_models`, `loaded_models`, `pull_model`, `run_model`,
  `unload_model`, and `delete_model`; LM Studio declares
  `list_models`/`list_downloaded`, `loaded_models`, `pull_model`, `load_model`,
  `chat`, `unload_model`, and `delete_model` (`remove_path` with
  `lms-disk-path` resolution);
  llama.cpp declares list, loaded-list, pull, load, unload, and native cache
  delete with exact model ids. `loaded_models` reports
  models currently resident in memory, name-extracted via the same declarative
  `result` spec with optional nested-path and row filters: Ollama uses
  `GET /api/ps`, LM Studio filters nonempty `loaded_instances` from
  `GET /api/v1/models`, and llama.cpp matches nested `status.value == loaded`
  records from `GET /models`.
- The bundled llama.cpp launch fixes `--sleep-idle-seconds 300`: after five
  minutes without inference work, a loaded model releases its model and
  KV-cache memory and wakes on the next request. The router child remains alive
  and can retain a residual backend GPU context. Its readiness probe requires
  `/props` to report `role:"router"`; a single-model listener is incompatible
  and must not be started or adopted because its `/models` contract does not
  expose router residency state.
- Per-engine stdout/stderr log capture and structured operational error records, surfaced via the errors pipeline.
- A normalized node-level model list (`engine:models`): union of every running engine's `list_models`, name-extracted via each action's declarative `result` spec, plus the per-engine set of models loaded in memory (`loadedByEngine`, from each engine's `loaded_models` action). A successful explicit empty inventory remains an engine key with `[]`; a missing/malformed/failed inventory omits that engine key instead of being mislabeled as authoritative empty. A watcher polls the loaded set and pushes `engine:models-changed` when it changes (explicit load/unload, JIT auto-load, TTL/idle eviction).
- Expose all of the above over the `engine:*` JSON-RPC surface to whatever orchestrates the service, plus an optional plain-HTTP LAN endpoint (`--http-port`, `GET /v1/models`) that serves the model list to a peer's discovery daemon (the list moved off the size-limited mDNS TXT onto HTTP).

**Out of scope**
- **Inference traffic** — stays with `nvpair-proxy`; this service never proxies `/api/chat` etc.
- **Multi-instance per engine and an MCP server** — future-additive, not v1.
- **The node's error list** — owned by `nvpair-errors`, which holds it as in-memory session state; this service only emits `errors:report` / `errors:clear`.
- Automatic deletion of persistent llama.cpp model-cache files.

## 3. Key Use Cases
- **Install an engine, user-mode**: `engine:install {engine:"ollama"}` downloads the per-OS user-scoped package (Windows/Linux standalone archive extracted into a user dir; macOS app bundle — never an elevated `Setup.exe` or `curl | sh`), checksum-verifies, extracts, re-detects.
- **Run lifecycle**: `engine:start` / `engine:stop` / `engine:restart` / `engine:status`, with readiness and health probes against the engine's loopback port.
- **Run a declared action**: `engine:action {engine, action, params}` → the manifest-declared HTTP call to the engine's loopback control API (e.g. `127.0.0.1:{port}/api/pull`). (Methods, notifications, and UI events all use the colon form `engine:*`, matching the POC UI and the `errors:*` notifications.)
- **Onboard a new engine (no code)**: a vendor adds `engines/<vendor>.json`; the generic runner exposes their lifecycle + actions immediately.
- **Edge case — already installed**: detect short-circuits install (idempotent).
- **Edge case — checksum mismatch**: install fails before `run`, is reported, and never executes an unverified payload.
- **Edge case — readiness timeout / crash**: failed readiness returns to Stopped; a later crash flips health and is reported.

## 4. Open Questions / Risks
- **`engine:*` method stability**: the Broker forwards the namespace verbatim; evolve it additively and preserve `engine:get-installed` as the installed-engine query.
- **`severity` / `action` enums**: current wire values are `info|warning|error` and `dismiss|retry|none`; coordinate any future shared-enum expansion without changing existing values.
- **Risk — auto-restart policy**: off by default (opt-in manifest flag); revisit once a supervisor / Warden-equivalent exists.
- **Risk — dynamic port assignment**: manifest `port: 0` reserves the option; range/policy TBD (may move to a future supervisor).
- **Risk — admin-only installers**: `mode: "admin"` is a flagged, refused exception, not the default; product direction is strictly user-mode.
- **Risk — LAN-open inference bind (interim)**: inference engines default `runtime.bind` to `0.0.0.0` (ordinary engines stay loopback; a per-call `bind` re-pins). This is a deliberate, temporary exception to the loopback-only posture; narrow it once authenticated inference transport exists. The engine-manager `ec` control surface is already protected independently by pin-based mTLS.
- **Future — declared/tunable env layer**: `runtime.env` is static today. A "declared tunables" layer (manifest-declared knobs, UI/broker-overridable per start) is worth adding; by env-richness the priority is Ollama → llama.cpp/Jan → vLLM (LM Studio / GPT4All are flags/settings-driven, not env). Related: `runtime.env` is process-mode-only — extending it to command-mode start commands is a deliberate, still-open choice. See `MANIFEST.md` → "Engine config reference".
- **Model deletion where the vendor has no command (LM Studio)**: implemented via the generic **`remove_path`** action kind — a manifest-declared, param-templated path the runner removes with safety rails (must resolve under a declared allowed root, reject `..`/symlink escapes). LM Studio's `delete_model` uses `model_resolution: "lms-disk-path"` to map logical ids to on-disk files via `lms ls --json` before deleting under `{models_dir}`, then `restart_after` to bounce a running server: LM Studio answers `/v1/models` from an index built at startup and exposes no rescan, so clients keep being offered the deleted model until it restarts. Ollama deletes via `DELETE /api/delete` (no restart needed) and ejects via `unload_model` (`POST /api/generate` with `keep_alive: 0`). llama.cpp deletes native cache entries via `DELETE /models` with the exact model id in a URL-encoded query parameter; the router updates its inventory in-process, so it also needs no restart.

## 5. Requirements

**Functional**
- Load + validate per-engine JSON manifests (bundled + user dir); select the host `<goos>/<goarch>` block; resolve placeholders (`{bin}`, `{cli}`, `{port}`, `{download}`, `{install_dir}`). Install commands also receive resolved download and destination paths in child-scoped `NVPAIR_INSTALL_*` environment variables so shell reparsing cannot corrupt them.
- Support both `process` (owned foreground) and `command` (daemon + control-CLI) runtimes; execute detect / install / uninstall / start / stop / restart / status / health and HTTP **or** CLI actions; emit `engine:*` results and notifications.
- Bound process-mode stops: on Unix send SIGTERM to the owned process group, then SIGKILL after `runtime.stop.grace_s` (five seconds by default); `signal:"kill"` skips the grace. On Windows, windowless managed engines require immediate `taskkill /T /F`.
- Emit `errors:report` / `errors:clear` on its stdio for the Broker to forward to `nvpair-errors`.

**Non-functional**
- Compiles and runs on Windows / macOS / Linux × amd64 / arm64.
- **User mode, no runtime admin/sudo**; stdio / `--ipc` is the primary control channel, with an optional plain-HTTP model-list listener and a clustered pin-gated mTLS control listener; engines bind loopback by default, but a manifest's `runtime.bind` can open an inference engine to the LAN (Ollama ships `0.0.0.0` to serve the cluster), overridable per-call via `engine:start {bind}`; HTTPS-only downloads, checksum-verified when the manifest pins a `sha256`.
- Fully testable end-to-end with no real engines, network, or installers in the test path.
- Small, readable, minimal-dependency.

## 6. Inputs and Outputs

**Inputs** — from the orchestrator (`nvpair-ui-broker`) over stdio / `--ipc`, plus engine manifests from disk. Newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 `engine:*` requests; manifest JSON (`engine`, `display_name`, `manifest_version`, `platforms{<os/arch>{detect, install, runtime}}`, `actions`). Every manifest is validated on load and rejected with a specific, human-readable error if malformed; manifests are read-only to this service.

`EngineStatus` object (returned by `engine:status` and `engine:get-installed`):
```json
{
  engine: string
  display_name: string
  installed: boolean
  running: boolean
  healthy: boolean
  port: number
}
```

`LogLine` object (entry in `engine:logs`):
```json
{ time: string, stream: "stdout" | "stderr", text: string }
```

Errors are emitted with the `nvpair-shared/errors.ServiceError` wire shape (`id`, `message`, `severity`, `action`, …), mirrored locally in `reporter.go` with identical JSON tags. `id` follows `engine-manager:<class>:<engine>`; the Broker stamps `nodeId` / `timestamp`.

Example request:
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"engine:install","params":{"engine":"ollama"}}
```

**Outputs** — JSON-RPC responses/notifications to the orchestrator; spawned engine OS processes; loopback HTTP to the engine's control API; `errors:report` / `errors:clear` notifications the Broker forwards to `nvpair-errors`. Lifecycle is not a hot path; error emits are best-effort (no-op if `nvpair-errors` is down). stdout writes are serialized so frames never interleave.

Example error notification:
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"errors:report","params":{"id":"engine-manager:install-failed:ollama","message":"sha256 mismatch","severity":"error"}}
```

## 7. API / Interface Contract
The stdio interface toward the local orchestrator (`nvpair-ui-broker`) is the primary surface. In addition, a clustered node serves a cluster-scoped remote-control surface (the `ec` service) directly over pin-based mTLS — engine-manager terminates that mTLS itself (see §7.2), the one place inter-node crypto lives here rather than in the orchestrator.

### 7.0 Methods and notifications
All traffic is JSON-RPC 2.0, newline-delimited over stdio (default) or `--ipc` (Unix domain socket / Windows named pipe).

Requests (caller → service):

| Method | Params | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `engine:get-installed` | — | `{ engines: [EngineStatus] }` |
| `engine:describe` | `{ engine }` | the engine's manifest |
| `engine:status` | `{ engine }` | `EngineStatus` |
| `engine:install` | `{ engine }` | `EngineStatus` (after install) |
| `engine:uninstall` | `{ engine }` | `EngineStatus` (after removal) |
| `engine:uninstall-managed` | — | `{ engines: [{ engine, removed, error? }] }` — removes the engines this service installed, selected by their install marker, each through the `engine:uninstall` path. Backs both clients' "reset all data"; the platform uninstallers reach the same code through `--uninstall-managed` because they have no broker. Neither `removed` nor `error` means the engine was left alone as not ours. |
| `engine:start` | `{ engine }` | `EngineStatus` (after readiness) |
| `engine:stop` | `{ engine }` | `EngineStatus` |
| `engine:restart` | `{ engine }` | `EngineStatus` |
| `engine:action` | `{ engine, action, params }` | the engine's raw response |
| `engine:logs` | `{ engine }` | `{ lines: [LogLine] }` |
| `engine:errors` | — | `{ errors: [ServiceError] }` |
| `engine:catalog` | `{ engine, platform?, arch?, query? }` | `{ models: [CatalogModel], source, platform?, arch?, fetchedAt?, searchable?, query? }` — the models an engine can **download**. One curated source per engine: Ollama's is compiled in (`catalog/ollama-models.json`, no network), LM Studio's is the `lmstudio-community` Hugging Face org fetched live and cached, and llama.cpp's is the GGUF repos of `ggml-org`, `bartowski`, and `unsloth`, fetched live and cached, offered as `repo:Q4_K_M`. Only llama.cpp's is `searchable`: a `query` searches all of Hugging Face for GGUF repos, each query cached on its own, and is echoed back; a query over 100 characters is an error rather than being shortened; other sources ignore it and return their whole list. `platform` and `arch` are the GOOS and GOARCH the models will be installed on; omitting both means this host, and naming a platform without an arch leaves the arch unknown rather than borrowing this host's. `appleOnly` rows (MLX) are kept only for a `darwin`/`arm64` target. An engine with no curated source is an error, not an empty list. The Ollama reply is a single multi-megabyte frame — every hop on its path must allow `jsonrpc.WorkerFrameBytes`. |
| `engine:remote-get-installed` | `{ node }` | `{ engines: [EngineStatus] }` from the remote node |
| `engine:remote-install` | `{ node, engine, start? }` | `{ opId, status }` after the remote install |
| `engine:remote-pull-model` | `{ node, engine, model?, params? }` | `{ opId, result }` after the remote pull |
| `engine:remote-load-model` | `{ node, engine, model }` | the remote action result |
| `engine:remote-unload-model` | `{ node, engine, model }` | the remote action result |
| `engine:remote-delete-model` | `{ node, engine, model }` | the remote action result |
| `engine:remote-start` | `{ node, engine, port? }` | `EngineStatus` from the remote node (manifest `runtime.bind`; no per-call bind on the remote path) |
| `engine:remote-stop` | `{ node, engine }` | `EngineStatus` from the remote node |
| `engine:wake` | `{ engine }` | `EngineStatus` — starts the engine only if its saved intent is On; intent-neutral; holds the engine's lifecycle lock like `engine:restart`; refused once shutdown has begun |
| `engine:sleep` | `{ engine }` | `EngineStatus` — the `doStop` that restart and shutdown use; intent-neutral |
| `engine:intent` | — | `{ enabledByEngine }` — saved intent per registered engine; no saved intent reads as `false` |
| `engine:unload-model` | `{ engine, model }` | the engine's raw response, via the per-engine unload mapping |
| `engine:remote-policy-get` | `{ nodeId }` | the target broker's `policy:get` result |
| `engine:remote-policy-set` | `{ nodeId, policy }` | the target broker's `policy:set` result |
| `engine:remote-availability-set` | `{ nodeId, state }` | the target broker's `node:set-availability` result |
| `shutdown` | — | `null` |
| `log/set-level` | `{ level }` | `{ level }` |

Notifications (service → caller): `engine:intent-changed{enabledByEngine}` (after an explicit start/stop changes saved intent), `policy:request{id, method, caller, params}` / `policy:cancel{id}` (a paired node's node-policy call for the broker, which answers with the `policy:reply{id, result, error?}` notification), `ready{version}`, `engine:state-changed{EngineStatus}`, `engine:models-changed{engine, models}` (pushed when an engine's loaded-in-memory model set changes; `models` is the full `engine:models` shape incl. `loadedByEngine`), `engine:install-progress{engine, stage, percent?, error?}` (`error` on the terminal `failed` frame), `engine:pull-progress{engine, op, stage, percent?, message}` (live progress for a local model pull driven via `engine:action{action:"pull_model"}` — the local counterpart of `engine:remote-progress`), `engine:remote-progress{opId, node, engine, op, stage, percent?, message}` (live progress relayed from a remote install/pull), and `errors:report` / `errors:clear` (consumed by `nvpair-errors` via the Broker). `install` / `start` / `stop` / `restart` / `action` / `remote-*` each run in their own goroutine so the read loop never blocks; their responses arrive when the op completes.

`percent` on all three progress notifications follows one rule: it is present only when the step is measurable (download bytes, byte-progress pulls) or terminal (`100` on install `done` / `already-installed`, `-1` on install `failed` and pull `error`). An indeterminate step omits it — the install `verified` and `installing` stages always do, because the install command is opaque — and a consumer renders the stage alone rather than a percentage.

Example `engine:install-progress` (stdout):
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"engine:install-progress","params":{"engine":"ollama","stage":"downloading","percent":42}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"engine:install-progress","params":{"engine":"ollama","stage":"installing"}}
```

Example `engine:pull-progress` (stdout):
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"engine:pull-progress","params":{"engine":"ollama","op":"pull","stage":"pulling","percent":62,"message":"pulling"}}
```

### 7.1 Versioning
- `engine:*` method names are namespaced and additive — new methods, never breaking changes to existing ones.
- `manifest_version` gates manifest-schema evolution: unknown optional fields are ignored (backward-compatible growth); a version higher than supported is rejected.

### 7.2 Remote engine management (the `ec` surface)
With `--control-port` and a clustered `--cluster-dir`, engine-manager serves a cluster-scoped remote-control surface over pin-based mTLS (`nvpair-shared/clustertrust`): it presents this node's cluster leaf, requires a client cert, and `403`s any caller that isn't a byte-for-byte pinned cluster peer. The listener is bound whenever `--control-port` is set and admits callers by live membership — its leaf is resolved per handshake, so an unclustered node presents none and every handshake is refused — so no restart is needed on `cluster:identity-changed`; the broker registers `ec` whenever a cluster dir is configured. Routes under `/v1`: `GET /engines`, streaming `POST /engines/install` and `/models/pull` (chunked NDJSON — zero+ `{"type":"progress"}` frames then one terminal `{"type":"result"}`/`{"type":"error"}` frame), non-streaming `POST /models/{load,unload,delete}`, and non-streaming `POST /engines/{start,stop}` returning `EngineStatus`. The node-policy routes `POST /node-policy/get`, `POST /node-policy/set` and `POST /node-availability/set` (bodies `{}`, `{policy}`, `{state}`; at most 256 KiB; unknown fields refused) are pin-gated with the caller's identity, clear any `nodeId` so no further hop is possible, and relay to the local broker as `policy:request` carrying the authenticated `caller`; the broker owns and re-authorizes the call. `engine:remote-policy-get` / `-set` and `engine:remote-availability-set` are their client half, addressed by `nodeId`.

The `engine:remote-*` methods are the client half: engine-manager resolves the target `node` in an `ec` peer directory (fed by its own `discovery:subscribe{services:[ec]}` to the broker relay), dials the peer's `ec` surface with the same pinned identity, relays each streamed progress frame up as `engine:remote-progress` (keyed by a minted `opId`), and settles the request on the terminal frame. Remote install/pull run for the operation's full duration (no broker-imposed timeout); remote stop and model unload/delete are fast request/response, remote Ollama model load uses the readiness-sized response budget, and remote start waits for the engine's bounded readiness result. They error if this node isn't clustered or the target isn't a pinned peer.

## 8. Dependencies
- **Upstream**: the orchestrator that spawns it and forwards `engine:*` (`nvpair-ui-broker`).
- **Downstream**: `nvpair-errors` (via the Broker's `errors:report` / `errors:clear` forwarding); the managed engine processes.
- **External**: engine vendors' download URLs (HTTPS; checksum-pinned when a `sha256` is set, else HTTPS-only with a warning); first-party `nvpair-shared/applog` (logging + `log/set-level`) and `nvpair-shared/clustertrust` (pin-based mTLS). The `nvpair-shared/errors` wire shape is mirrored locally with identical JSON tags. No third-party runtime services.

## 9. Data Ownership
- **Owned**: the in-memory engine registry (parsed manifests + per-engine runtime state) and per-engine log/error ring buffers — transient only.
- **Source of truth**: no — `nvpair-errors` owns the node's error list (in memory, for the session); model inventories belong to the engines; manifests on disk are authored elsewhere.
- **Storage**: in-memory; manifests read from the per-user data dir's
  `engines/*.json` (`%LocalAppData%\Nvidia Corporation\Personal AI Router` on
  Windows, `~/.config/Nvidia Corporation/Personal AI Router` on Linux, and
  `~/Library/Application Support/Nvidia Corporation/Personal AI Router` on
  macOS) plus bundled `manifests/*.json`. Each engine's model store is declared
  as `models_dir` outside that data dir (`~/.ollama`, `~/.llamacpp`,
  `~/.lmstudio/models`) so neither an engine uninstall nor the app-level data
  purge removes downloaded models; clearing one is the user's own choice, made
  per model through `delete_model`.

  Removing an engine deletes only the paths its manifest's `uninstall.remove`
  names, and never its `models_dir`. The store is recognised by file identity,
  not by path: a store reached through a symlink keeps both the link and the
  directory it leads to, and a spelling that differs only in case is the store
  wherever the filesystem says so. Removal unlinks a symlink or junction rather
  than following it, and refuses a target that is the store or inside it.

  One persisted file: `engine-bin/<engine>/installed-by-pair.json`, written after
  an install this service performed. It is the only record distinguishing an
  install PAIR made from one the user made themselves, which an engine whose
  vendor script chooses its own destination cannot be told apart any other way,
  and it gates both `engine:uninstall` for such an engine and
  `engine:uninstall-managed`. No database.

## 10. Design Constraints
- **Performance**: control plane, not inference; sub-second RPCs except install (network-bound) and start (bounded by the readiness timeout).
- **Scalability**: a handful of engines per node; one managed instance per engine in v1.
- **Reliability**: best-effort; readiness + health probes; automatic restart on crash is planned but **not yet implemented** (see §4); install is one-shot and idempotent (detect short-circuits).
- **Security**: **user mode only — no admin/sudo at runtime** (escalation reserved for product install and uninstall time: the Windows uninstaller is elevated and runs `--uninstall-managed`, which for that reason loads only the manifests compiled into the binary, never the user-writable override directory); both optional LAN listeners terminate pin-based mTLS and reject unpinned peers — the read-only model-list listener (`em`) because a node's model inventory is cluster data, and the `ec` control listener because its routes are privileged; `em` additionally serves plaintext on loopback only, for this node's own scanner; engines bind loopback by default, but a manifest's `runtime.bind` may open an inference engine to the LAN (Ollama defaults to `0.0.0.0`, overridable per-call); downloads are HTTPS-only (plain HTTP only from loopback) and checksum-verified before execution when the manifest pins a `sha256` (an unpinned fetch is HTTPS-only with a loud warning, like a `script` install).
- **Compliance**: no PII; payloads carry engine/model identifiers and error messages only.

## 11. Assumptions
- The orchestrator owns the stdio/IPC pipe and is the only peer; on parent exit (stdin EOF) the service shuts down cleanly — no reconnect or buffering.
- Manifests are either well-formed (validated) or rejected; authors keep `engine:*` and manifest shapes stable per the versioning rules.
- Engines bind loopback unless the manifest's `runtime.bind` opts otherwise (inference engines default to `0.0.0.0`; a per-call `bind` overrides); the engine's own startup banner is not trusted — the readiness probe confirms the actual bind.
- `nvpair-errors` is best-effort; its absence degrades to local logs only.

## 12. Failure Modes and Mitigations
- **Download / checksum failure on install**: engine stays NotInstalled. → Fail fast before `run`; `engine:install-progress` error + `errors:report` (`engine-manager:install-failed:<engine>`); never execute an unverified payload.
- **Engine fails its readiness probe**: start never reaches Running. → Bounded ready timeout → back to Stopped; structured error; no half-started state.
- **Engine process crashes**: engine unavailable. → A watcher flips state, emits `engine:state-changed` + `errors:report` (`engine-manager:exited:<engine>`); the parent's supervisor reports if the *manager itself* dies. (Automatic restart is planned — see §4 — not yet implemented.)
- **`nvpair-errors` unavailable**: failures absent from the node's error list. → The Broker no-ops the forward; local applog + ring buffers still hold everything.
- **Invalid / unknown-OS manifest**: that engine is unusable. → Reject at load with a specific error; other engines unaffected.

## 13. Observability
- **Logging**: structured `slog` to stderr via `nvpair-shared/applog` (captured by the parent's debug panel); per-engine stdout/stderr ring buffers; key events — install fetch/verify/run outcomes, start/ready/stop transitions, health flips, action invocations, every failure.
- **Metrics**: lightweight in-process counters (installs, starts, failures, health transitions per engine), surfaced via `engine:status` and `engine:errors`; no separate metrics endpoint in v1.
- **Alerts**: surfaced through the errors pipeline — `errors:report` for install/start/health failures and manager crashes; the UI's error list is the alerting surface for v1.

## 14. Sample usage
The operator opens the UI; the Broker calls `engine:get-installed`, which returns each manifest's `EngineStatus` (e.g. Ollama `installed:true, running:false`). To set up a missing engine, the Broker sends `engine:install {engine:"ollama"}`: the service downloads the per-OS user-scoped package, checksum-verifies it, runs it user-mode, and re-detects — progress streaming as `engine:install-progress` notifications.

The operator starts it: `engine:start {engine:"ollama"}` resolves the manifest runtime (`OLLAMA_HOST` = `{host}:{port}`, `{host}` from `runtime.bind` defaulting to `0.0.0.0`; per-call `port`/`bind` override either), spawns the process, and waits for the readiness probe before reporting `running:true, healthy:true` in the response and an `engine:state-changed` notification. A periodic health probe keeps the state current; an unexpected exit emits `engine:state-changed` + `errors:report`. If something is already serving the port, `start` **adopts** it instead of spawning a duplicate.

The operator stops it: `engine:stop {engine:"ollama"}` signals a process the service owns. For an **adopted** engine (no owned process), it resolves the PID bound to the port and terminates it only when that process is running the binary we manage — reclaiming an orphan a prior run left on our own managed port; a genuinely foreign listener (a different image on a different port) is declined with an error naming its PID and image. A user-initiated `stop` records the OFF intent regardless (even when the RPC returns an error), so the health loop and restore-on-restart don't flip the engine back on — clients must not treat a stop error as proof the OFF choice was discarded. The cluster `ec` stop endpoint shares this semantics and may return HTTP 500 while OFF is persisted.

The operator pulls a model: `engine:action {engine:"ollama", action:"pull_model", params:{name:"llama3.2"}}` issues the manifest-declared `POST 127.0.0.1:{port}/api/pull`. Because the action is `pull_model`, the request is routed through the streaming pull path (not the buffered `engine:action` reader): each `/api/pull` status line is emitted as an `engine:pull-progress` notification — so a local pull shows live download progress just like a remote pull's `engine:remote-progress` — and the request settles with the pull's terminal result line. Frames are coalesced (only a change in `stage` or `percent` is emitted) so a chatty engine that streams many byte-progress lines per layer doesn't flood subscribers. Streaming Ollama and llama.cpp pulls use a 30-minute inactivity watchdog that is refreshed only when a layer/file completed-byte count advances, allowing active downloads to exceed 30 minutes without letting duplicate progress or heartbeat frames keep a stalled pull alive. The engine's terminal `{"status":"success"}` surfaces as a `stage:"success"` frame; a **failed** pull emits a terminal `stage:"error", percent:-1, message:<why>` frame in addition to the JSON-RPC error, so a UI whose synchronous call already timed out on a long download still converges off "pulling". A CLI-driven pull (LM Studio's `lms get`) has no line-level progress, so it emits one `stage:"pulling"` marker and retains the fixed 30-minute action timeout before returning the command's result. On `shutdown` (or stdin EOF) the service stops every running engine first, so none are orphaned.

For the `llamacpp-models-sse` adapter, the monitored model must match
`params.model`. Subscribe before starting, and bound the `POST /models`
acknowledgement by a separate 30-second total timeout that survives caller
cancellation. Once accepted, any exit before a matching `download_finished` or
`download_failed` event performs cleanup before returning: caller cancellation,
remote disconnect, inactivity timeout, SSE read failure, and premature SSE EOF
all take this path. Using the same captured router URL and a fresh five-second
context, query `GET /models` and send `POST /models/unload` with the exact model
only if its status is still `downloading`. Missing or completed models need no
stop request, and persistent cache files are retained. Validate the unload
acknowledgement (`success:true`); join cleanup failures to the original error
without losing cancellation or inactivity causes. A lost or malformed start
acknowledgement means acceptance and cancellation cannot be confirmed: do not
unload a download without confirmed ownership. Neither terminal SSE event
triggers cleanup. These operations retain the existing JSON-RPC and progress
payloads and do not terminate the entire engine when cleanup fails.

## 15. Current integration / wiring

The engine manager builds standalone (`go build ./...`) and is tested end to
end over stdio. Current product wiring is:

1. `build.bat` and `build.sh` build the version from `versions.json` and stage
   the binary in the repository-root `build/bin/` bundle.
2. `installer/nvpair-setup.nsi` bundles the Windows binary and owns the local
   subnet firewall rules for its model-list and cluster-control listeners.
3. `nvpair-ui-broker` supervises the process, relays its `engine:*` JSON-RPC
   surface, forwards engine events and errors, and registers its applicable
   discovery services.
4. The bundled graphical UI, `nvpair-tui`, and other clients use the broker
   contract rather than owning engine-manager process wiring. Product packaging
   places the graphical UI alongside the broker and workers in the same
   installation directory.
5. `nvpair-engine-manager/README.md`, `nvpair-ui-broker/README.md`, and the
   cross-process tests are the current architecture, protocol, and
   integration references.

The retired desktop wiring is intentionally omitted; its implementation record
remains available in Git history and is not part of the current architecture.
